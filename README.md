## README Template

Here is an example of how the README of a use case should be filled:

```markdown
# Use Case Title

This use case demonstrates how Cline can be used to [do something].

**Goal:** [Describe the goal of the use case in a concise and impactful way].

**User instructions to Cline assistant:** [Describe the instructions of the use case].
```

The README Template is to be filled within each use case folder. This is important because it helps to define the goal and scenario of the use case before any work is done. This ensures that the use case is focused and that the work is aligned with the intended outcome. This should be done before anything else when working on a use case folder.
