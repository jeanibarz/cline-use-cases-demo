# Code Generation

Generate a FastAPI endpoint with a router named 'items', a prefix of '/items', and two routes: a GET route at '/' named 'read_items' that returns a list of sample items, and a GET route at '/{item_id}' named 'read_item' that returns the item ID. Set up a virtual environment for the project, install the necessary dependencies, and run the FastAPI application. If any errors occur, identify and resolve them, ensuring the application runs successfully.
